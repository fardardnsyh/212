# :Introduction

Python is an object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability. In Python, everything is an object, and understanding the nature of objects is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free code. In this blog post, we'll delve into the fundamentals of Python objects, including their identification, mutability, and the implications of mutable and immutable objects.

<br>

# :ID and Type

Every object in Python has a unique identifier (id) and a type. The id represents the memory address of the object, while the type defines the class or data type of the object. This unique combination of id and type is what distinguishes one object from another.
<br>

## <sub-index-color>1</sub-index-color> ID

### <sub-index-color>-</sub-index-color> You can access object id by id function.

```python

x = [1, 2, 3]

# Display the memory address of the variable x
print(id(x)) # 139926795932424


y = x

# Display the memory address of the variable y
print(id(y)) # 139926795932424
print(y is x) # True
print(y == x) # True

```

<br>

<mdContainer class='blue'>
As I mentioned above, the id returned from ID function is unique, but y and x have the same id.
</mdContainer>

<br>

<mdTextContainer class="red">
<boxTitle class="red">
INFO
</boxTitle>
1, "is" is a type of operation for identity comparison.<br>
2, y is assigned the memory address of x, so x and y are pointing the same reference.<br>
3, the reason above, the values of x and y are the same. <br>
</mdTextContainer>

<br>

### <sub-index-color>-</sub-index-color> How about this case?

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]

# guess True or False
print(x == y)
print(x is Y)

```

<br>

<mdContainer class="blue">
"x == y" must be True because both have the same values.<br>
but "x is y" is False... Why??
</mdContainer>

<br>

<mdTextContainer class="red">
<boxTitle class="red">
INFO
</boxTitle>
1, y is assigned a new value [1, 2, 3] which is not from somewhere already allocated.<br>
2, So y has different id to x.
</mdTextContainer>

### Ok, I can see the pattern now.

<br>

## <sub-index-color>3</sub-index-color> Type

### <sub-index-color>-</sub-index-color> You can use type function to check object type

```python
a = 90
print(type(90)) # <class 'int'>
print(type(i) == int)

```

### <sub-index-color>-</sub-index-color> type is actually class

```python
class MyClass:
  pass

instance = MyClass()
print(type(instance) == MyClass) # True

```

<br>

# :Aliases

An alias typically refers to an alternative name assigned to an existing variable, module, function, or class. It allows you to refer to the same entity by different names within the scope of your code.

```python
list_1 = [1, 2, 3]
list_2 = list_1 # list_2 becomes an alias for 'list_1'
print(list_1 is list_2) # True

```

<br>

# :Mutable objects

A mutable object is an object whose state or value can be modified after it is created. This means that you can change the content, add, or remove elements of a mutable object without changing its identity (memory location).

## <sub-index-color>1</sub-index-color> List

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 99  # Modifying an element in-place

```

## <sub-index-color>2</sub-index-color> Dictionary

```python
my_dict = {'key': 'value'}
my_dict['new_key'] = 'new_value'  # Adding a new key-value pair

```

## <sub-index-color>3</sub-index-color> Set

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(4)  # Adding an element to the set

```

## <sub-index-color>4</sub-index-color> Bytearray

```python
my_bytearray = bytearray(b'hello')
my_bytearray[0] = 65  # Mutable: elements can be modified

```

# :Immutable objects

An immutable object is an object whose state or value cannot be modified after it is created. Once an immutable object is created, its content remains fixed throughout its lifetime. Any operation that appears to modify the object actually creates a new object with the modified content.

## <sub-index-color>1</sub-index-color> Integers

```python
x = 5
# Attempting to modify x results in creating a new object
y = x + 2

```

## <sub-index-color>2</sub-index-color> Float

```python
pi = 3.14159
# Attempting to modify pi results in creating a new object
pi_squared = pi ** 2

```

## <sub-index-color>3</sub-index-color> String

```python
my_string = "Hello"
# Attempting to modify my_string results in creating a new object
my_modified_string = my_string + ", World!"

```

## <sub-index-color>4</sub-index-color> Tuple

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# Attempting to modify my_tuple results in creating a new object
my_new_tuple = my_tuple + (4, 5)

```

## <sub-index-color>5</sub-index-color> Frozenset

Frozensets are immutable sets.

```python
my_frozenset = frozenset({1, 2, 3})
# Immutable: elements cannot be modified or added
# my_frozenset.add(4)  # This line would raise an AttributeError

```

## <sub-index-color>6</sub-index-color> Byte

```python
my_bytes = b'hello'
# Attempting to modify the content results in an error
# my_bytes[0] = 65  # TypeError: 'bytes' object does not support item assignment

```

## <sub-index-color>7</sub-index-color> Complex

In mathematics, a complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit, defined as the square root of -1. The symbol i represents the imaginary unit, and it has the property that iÂ² = -1.

```python
# Using the complex() constructor
z1 = complex(3, 2)  # 3 + 2i
z2 = complex(-4, -7)  # -4 - 7i

# Using the j suffix
z3 = 1 + 4j  # 1 + 4i
z4 = -2 - 3j  # -2 - 3i

```

<br>

# :What if immutable container have mutable value

Tuples and frozensets are immutable objects, meaning that their structure cannot be changed after creation. However, it's important to distinguish between the immutability of the container itself and the immutability of the objects it contains.

## <sub-index-color>1</sub-index-color> Tuples

- Tuples are immutable, but they can contain mutable objects.
- The tuple itself cannot be modified (elements added or removed), but if a tuple contains references to mutable objects (e.g., lists), the state of those mutable objects can be changed.

```python
mutable_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = (4, 5, mutable_list)

# While the tuple is immutable...
# You can modify the mutable list inside the tuple
mutable_list.append(4)

print(my_tuple)  # Output: (4, 5, [1, 2, 3, 4])

```

## <sub-index-color>2</sub-index-color> Frozensets:

- Frozensets, unlike regular sets, are immutable and can be used as keys in dictionaries.
- They can also contain immutable or hashable objects.

Interning is a memory optimization strategy where a single object is reused for equal values to reduce memory consumption.
```python
mutable_set = {1, 2, 3}
frozen_set = frozenset({4, 5, mutable_set})

# You can't modify the frozenset itself...
# But you can modify the mutable set inside the frozenset
mutable_set.add(4)

print(frozen_set)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, {1, 2, 3, 4}})

```

# :Interning

### <sub-index-color>-</sub-index-color> Let's see the next example!

```python
a = "hello"
b = "hello"

# guess True or False
print(a == b)
print(a is b)
```

<br>

<mdContainer class="blue">
"a == b" must be True because both have the same value "hello.<br>
but "x is y" is True... Why??
</mdContainer>

<br>

<mdTextContainer class="red">
<boxTitle class="red">
INFO
</boxTitle>  
In Python, some immutable literals, such as small integers, some strings automatically interned.<br><br>

The goal of interning is to reduce memory consumption by ensuring that only one copy of a particular value is stored in memory, and multiple references to that value point to the same object.

</mdTextContainer>

### <sub-index-color>-</sub-index-color> Integer have the similar behaviour

```python
i = 256
n = 256

print(i == n) # True
print(i is n) # True

k = 257
j = 257
print(k is j) # False

```

### ??? Why "i is n" == True, but "k is j == False"?

## Let's see the next topic

# :Preallocated integers

<br>

<mdTextContainer class="yellow">
<boxTitle class="yellow">
Concept
</boxTitle>
In CPython, the concept of preallocation is specifically associated with small integers within a certain range. During the initialization of the Python interpreter, a block of memory is reserved to preallocate small integer objects. The range for preallocated small integers is determined by constants such as NSMALLPOSINTS and NSMALLNEGINTS.
</mdTextContainer>

<br>

<mdTextContainer class="yellow">
<boxTitle class="yellow">
Purpose
</boxTitle>
The purpose of preallocating is to improve performance by reducing the time and resources needed for memory allocation and deallocation.
</mdTextContainer>

## Ok, then what are NSMALLPOSINTS and NSMALLNEGINTS?

<mdContainer class="blue">
The terms NSMALLPOSINTS and NSMALLNEGINTS are related to the implementation details of the CPython interpreter, which is the default implementation of the Python programming language. 
</mdContainer>

### <sub-index-color>-</sub-index-color> NSMALLPOSINTS
This constant represents the number of small positive integers that are preallocated and cached by the CPython interpreter.(integers in the range [0, NSMALLPOSINTS])

### <sub-index-color>-</sub-index-color> NSMALLNEGINTS
Similarly, this constant represents the number of small negative integers that are preallocated and cached.(integers in the range [-NSMALLNEGINTS, -1])

<br>

<mdTextContainer class="red">
<boxTitle class="red">
INFO
</boxTitle>
NSMALLNEGINTS and NSMALLPOSINTS, can vary between different versions of CPython, and it's always a good idea to refer to the specific documentation or source code of the Python version you are using for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
</mdTextContainer>


# :Why mutable and immutable matter?

## <sub-index-color>1</sub-index-color> Predictable Behavior

Immutable objects provide predictable behavior in functions and operations since their values don't change.

## <sub-index-color>2</sub-index-color> Safety

Immutable objects are inherently safer in concurrent or multi-threaded environments as they eliminate the need for locks.

## <sub-index-color>3</sub-index-color>Hashability

Immutable objects can be hashed, making them suitable for keys in dictionaries and elements in sets.

# :How differently does Python treat mutable and immutable objects?

Python treats mutable and immutable objects differently in terms of memory management and assignment. Mutable objects are modified in-place, while immutable objects involve the creation of new objects.

## <sub-index-color>1</sub-index-color> Mutable Objects

```python
# Mutable object

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(id(my_list)) # 4375886080
my_list[0] = 99  # Modifying an element in-place
print(id(my_list)) # 4375886080
my_list.append(100) # mutable object have methods to modify its value
print(id(my_list)) # 4375886080
```

## <sub-index-color>2</sub-index-color> Imutable Objects

```python
string = "hello"
print(id(string)) # 4375955504
string_b = string.upper() # upper method return a new string
print(string_b) # HELLO
print(id(string_b)) # 4375955376 different id
print(id(string)) #  4375955504 still the same id
print(string) # hello

```

# :How arguments are passed to functions and what does that imply for mutable and immutable objects

Understanding how arguments are passed to functions is essential for grasping the impact of mutable and immutable objects.

## <sub-index-color>1</sub-index-color> Pass by Object Reference

Python uses a mechanism known as "pass by object reference." When passing arguments to functions, references to objects are passed, not the actual objects.

## <sub-index-color>2</sub-index-color> Mutable vs. Immutable Arguments

Mutable objects passed to a function can be modified within the function, affecting the original object. In contrast, modifying immutable objects creates new objects, leaving the original unchanged.

### Mutable

```python
def modify_list(my_list):
    my_list.append(4)

original_list = [1, 2, 3]
modify_list(original_list)
print(original_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

```

### Imutable

```python
def modify_string(my_string):
    my_string += " World"

original_string = "Hello"
modify_string(original_string)
print(original_string)  # Output: Hello
```

# Conclusion
